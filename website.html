    <p1>The demand for Taluk status for Kadaba was first raised by 'Kadaba Taluk Rachana Horata Samiti' and people of Kadaba in 1961. B.M Hundekar taluk re-organisation committee, in its recommendations in 1985, had suggested the formation of Kadaba taluk. Later, the Gaddigowdar Committee had also recommended the same. The government had appointed a special Tahsildar for Kadaba in 2001. However, in 2009, the Taluk reconstitution committee under the chairmanship of M.B Prakash had excluded Kadaba in its recommendations.

        In 2013, government declared Kadaba as Taluk along with Moodbidri of Dakshin Kannada District and Byndoor and Brahmavar of Udupi district. On 15 March 2017, Karnataka government under Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has re-declared Kadaba as Taluk again and from 1 January 2018 it is officially functioning as Taluk headquarters. Kadaba taluk is carved out of Puttur and Sullia taluks and the new taluk comprises nine villages from Puttur taluk and seven villages of Sullia. The creation of Kadaba taluk will benefit the people who have been travelling 65 km to the Puttur taluk office to get any work done. Now, the people of Subramnya, Nelyadi, Shiradi can reach the taluk head office by travelling a distance of only 10 to 20 km.</p1>

   <p5>The climate of Karnataka is basically tropical and determined largely by the physiographic and geographic location with respect to the sea and monsoon. The state enjoys the benefit of two monsoons and hence it will be called the land of two monsoons because both southwest and northeast monsoons account for major part of the rainfall.
